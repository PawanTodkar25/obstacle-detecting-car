# obstacle-detecting-car
This project details an autonomous car using an Arduino Uno to control DC motors via an L298N driver. An HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles in its path. When an object is too close, the Arduino signals the driver to halt the motors, preventing a collision. The system's logic is managed entirely by the Arduino program.
